# hdfsMetrics

This directory contains files for building artifacts for the hdfsMetrics 
project, which provides a Control Center sink for Apache Hadoop metrics.

*TODO:* This entire project should live in its own git repo, produce its own
artifacts, be versioned independently, etc.  For the time being it is only 
used in the hdfs image so this organization will stand.
