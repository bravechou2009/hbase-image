This directory contains the logic to build a tar file containing a combined image
of both OpenTSDB and Hbase for use by RM.

For information on how to construct a docker image using this tar file, see
[services/repos/hbase/README.md](../hbase/README.md)

Note that image is separate from one used by CC for its Internal Services,
though the two images may converge at some point in a future release.
